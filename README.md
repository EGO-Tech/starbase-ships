Blueprints and manuals for some ships for the game Starbase by Frozenbyte

## Miners

| Ship | Name | Description | Version | Ore Crates | Mining Lasers | Fast Travel Core |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <img src="rigger/images/rigger1.jpg" alt="Rigger" width="200" /> | [Rigger](rigger) | The Rigger is a fast medium sized mining ship. Although it has a limited autopilot and crash avoidance systems, it is mainly designed to be used in the safe zone. The blueprint is provided for free | v1.1.1 | 100 | 2 | No |
| <img src="stocker/photos/20211013183158_1.jpg" alt="Stocker" width="200" /> | [Stocker](stocker) | The Stocker is a 216 ore crate capacity fast travel capable mining ship. It is designed as a direct upgrade for those who have outgrown the [Rigger](rigger). The blueprint is provided for free | v1.0.2 | 216 | 4 | Yes |

## Asteroid Haulers

| Ship | Name | Description | Version | Asteroid Capacity | Loading Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <img src="pebbler/photos/20210924201205_1.jpg" alt="Pebbler" width="200" /> | [Pebbler](pebbler) | The Pebbler is an **experimental** asteroid hauling ship. It is designed to be used in the safe zone and haul small asteroids. It uses two tractor beams to position asteroids into compartments of cargo lock beams. Although it is not very lucrative, the Pebbler is no frills and will pay itself back in about four or five quick trips to the belt.| v1.1.1 | 4 | Slow |
| <img src="rocker/photos/20211002134507_1.jpg" alt="Rocker" width="200" /> | [Rocker](rocker) | The Rocker is an **experimental** asteroid hauling ship. It is designed to be used in the safe zone and haul small asteroids. It uses a tractor beam to position asteroids into five compartments of cargo lock beams in a circular pattern. It is a more polished and advanced version of the [Pebbler](pebbler) as it has load automation to approach and load asteroids in the right order as well as a material scanner that gives estimated credits for selling the asteroids.| v1.0.4 | 5 | Slow
| <img src="rocker_duo/photos/20211203224915_1.jpg" alt="Rocker Duo" width="200" /> | [Rocker Duo](rocker_duo) | The Rocker Duo is a asteroid hauling ship that is bascially two [Rockers](rocker) mashed together. It is designed to be used in the safe zone and haul small asteroids. It uses two tractor beams to position asteroids into two sets of five compartments of cargo lock beams in a circular pattern so it can hold up to ten asteroids. | v1.0.0 | 10 | Very Slow |
| <img src="hexxer/photos/20211130203152_1.jpg" alt="Hexxer" width="200" /> | [Hexxer](hexxer) | The Hexxer is a ship for hauling small asteroids, designed to be used in the safe zone. It uses six tractor beams to pull asteroids into six compartments of cargo lock beams in a hex pattern. It has load automation to approach and load asteroids in the right order to balance the ship as much as possible as well as a material scanner that gives estimated credits for selling the asteroids. It has similar functions to the [Rocker](../rocker) but loads a little quicker and has one more compartment.| v1.0.0 | 6 | Moderate |
