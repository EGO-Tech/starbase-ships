# Usage

To enter the ship, there is are buttons on either side of the body of the ship that will open `Doors`. Once inside you can also open and close the cockpit glass `Canopy`. Buttons for these are available in the pilot left side console and also on the ceiling above the pilot seat.

## Using the Waypoint System

![Pilot Left Console](https://github.com/EGO-Tech/starbase-ships/raw/main/shifter/images/pilot_left_console.jpg)

### Viewing and Selecting Waypoints

This uses the [NavGrid](https://github.com/pcbennion/starbase-navgrid) system. Use the `Down` and `Up` waypoints selectors to select waypoint. The selected waypoint information is shown on `NavP` and `NavC` panels.

On the pilot center console, `NavGrid` will show the compass towards the selected waypoint while `Attitude` will show the ship's pitch, heading and roll directions. `NavGrid` is best used while not moving.

### Editing and Saving Waypoints

Use `Set` to save waypoint of current location to the current selected waypoint position.

To edit currently selected waypoint, use your `U` tool to add name, X, Y and Z values to `nName`, `nX`, `nY` and `nZ` respectively. Then use the `Save` button to save.

<nord-banner variant="warning">

**NOTE:** Waypoint 1 to 6 are presets and can not be over written.

</nord-banner>

### Loading Waypoint to Auto Pilot

Use `Load to Auto Pilot` to load curretnly selected waypoint to `Target` to be used with the auto pilot system.

## Auto Pilot and Crash Avoidance

The ship uses a modified version of [NavCas](https://github.com/fixerid/sb-projects/tree/main/NavCas) which uses the 3 in 1 ISAN from Compass. Waypoints are loaded from NavGrid waypoint system.

Use while the ship is stationary. Activating `Nav` will start point the ship towards `Target` waypoint and deactivate itself when done. `Autopilot` will activate `Nav` and fly to within 5km of `Target` waypoint with `Avoidance` activated.

<nord-banner variant="warning">

**NOTE:** `Nav` may not be very accurate. I recommend using it in conjunction with the NavGrid compass. The `dd` panel on the pilot left console shows debugging information for NavCas.

</nord-banner>

`Avoidance` will activate `Guides`. If the guides detect objects it will cut thrust and strafe up or down (will flash either the top or bottom `Blue` warning lights on the pilot center console according to the direction) while sounding an alarm (check game settings if you do not hear the alarm).
It will also flash `Red` warning lights on the pilot center console according to the position of obstacle detected. If `Autopilot` is activated, it will readjust and continue its flight.

<nord-banner variant="warning">

**NOTE:** For safety, `Avoidance` will not activate if the mining lasers are turned on. Do not turn on `Avoidance`, `Autopilot` and `Nav` while lasers are turned on.

</nord-banner>

`Avoids` will show the counters for number of avoidances. The `Trip` counter can be reset by holding down the `Avoids` `Reset Trips` button.

<nord-banner variant="warning">

**NOTE:** There is very limited coverage of range finders for the crash avoidance system. **Use at your own risk!**

## Resetting Navigation

If ISAN or NavGrid is not working, it can be reset using the `Reset ISAN` button. Press once to take ISAN offline, then press again to reset.

For v1.0.0, this has to be done manually.
Since this ship has three ISAN panels (one each on the pilot, engineering and navigation consoles), before reseting ISAN, rename the `_` field of two of the panels to something else temporarily using the universal tool.
Then using your universal tool on the remaining ISAN panel, clear the value of the `_` field.
The first time will show ISAN as offline, repeat clearing the value again to reset ISAN and NavGrid. You can then rename the fields back to `_` on the two panels earlier.

## Mining

To approach an asteroid, point the center range finder at an asteroid and activate `Approach`. Once in range (optimum range is 16 to 20m on `Distance`), activate `Lasers` to turn on the mining lasers. Activating `Rotate` will rotate the laser drill.

The laser drill has three modes.

- `Fixed` mode will keep all lasers converged to the asteroid detected by the center range finder.
- `Manual` mode allows adjustment of the `Drill Pitch`. The pitch range is from `-15` to `20` degrees.
- `Auto` mode will activate `Rotate` and progressively increase the drill pitch with the rotations

`Drill Pitch` can only be adjusted in `Manual` mode. `Eco` mode will only use two lasers to conserve power.

`Mine` is a button which will activate automated mining. Point the center range finder at an asteroid and activate. It will activate `Material Scanner` and `Approach`, and once in range it will automatically activate `Lasers`.

`Collect` turns on the six ore collectors.

If batteries start running out of charge while mining, turn on `Min Gen`. Continous use of the lasers and collectors at the same time requires a `Min Generator Limit` of around 90%.

<nord-banner variant="warning">

**NOTE:** For safety, lasers will turn off if the total fuel is less that 2,000 units.

</nord-banner>

### Ore Scanner

Activate using the `Material Scanner` button. The laser will try to adjust to point at the objects detected by the center range finder. Scan results will show on the `Materials` panel in number of stacks. It has a maximum range of 100m.

### Managing Power and Fuel

See [Power and Fuel Systems](https://starbase.egotech.space/pages/systems/power/) on how to manage ship power and refuel.

### Refilling Propellant

See [Propellant Systems](https://starbase.egotech.space/pages/systems/propellant/) on how to refill propellant.

The two red propellant tanks on the bottom level at the back of ship can also be used to refill the ship. Connect the `Red` resource bridge to the `Green` resource bridge to transfer propellant.
You can then unbolt the red tanks and craft refills for the tanks using ice and then bolt the tank back to the support. Rinse and repeat until full. The `Red` and `Green` buttons toggles the respective resource bridges.
