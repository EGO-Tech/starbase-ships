# Known Issues

- When asteroids are loaded more on one side, the ship can become unbalanced and thrust efficiency drops
- Currently there are no navigation features but will possibly add ISAN and Compass in the future if this ship becomes useful to Endos
- Sometimes after printing the ship, the tractor beams' pitch are not right at the starting position, fix by manually setting the turret pitch (`tbh1` & `tbh2`) to `-15`. Or it will fix itself after you load an asteroid on each side (manually point beam at the asteroids).
