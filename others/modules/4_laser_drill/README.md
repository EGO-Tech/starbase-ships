This module is a rotating four laser drill on an advanced turret with pitching for all lasers plus a rangefinder in the center.
This base drill is used in the [Piercer](../../../piercer) mining ship, without the material point scanner.

The drill is bolted to a large hardpoint with a beam frame that can be welded to any ship.
