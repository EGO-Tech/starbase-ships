# Known Issues

- **For version 1.0.0**: Ship can get stuck in load sequence if `Load` is deactivated before completing. To reset, activate all lock beams and activate `Load` for all compartments. Then all lock beams can be deactivated.
- When asteroids are loaded more on one side, the ship can become unbalanced and appraoch will not work as well. Manual appraoch would probably be better.
- Currently there are no navigation features but will possibly add ISAN and Compass in the future if this ship becomes useful to Endos
